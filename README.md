# Coronary Heart Disease Prediction System Using Ensemble Learning

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to apply data mining techniques specifically Ensemble techniques on heart data of various patients using Python with Scikit-learn packages and also provide the user-friendly web interface where they could check their risk.
 - The Ensembling technique being used called Stacking.
 - The algorithms which are going to be used in Stacking are RFC(Random Forest Classifier), SVM (Support Vector Machines) and Neural Networks.
 - RF and SVM are used as base learners and Neural network as Stacked Learner

## Tools and Frameworks Used:
- <b>Lanugage:</b> Python 3
- <b>Framework:</b> Django Web Framework
- <b>Packages:</b> Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Joblib
